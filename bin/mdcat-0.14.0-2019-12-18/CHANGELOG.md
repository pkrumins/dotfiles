## [Unreleased]

## [0.14.0] – 2019-12-18
### Added
- Render images in [kitty] (see [GH-65] and [GH-104]).

  parser speed and correctness.

- Remove all features except `remote_resources` to reduce build complexity.

### Removed
- No longer depend on `immeta`.

## [0.13.0] – 2019-03-30
### Added
- Render task lists nicely (see [GH-72]).
- Render strike-through text (see [GH-71]).  Some terminals do not support this
  feature, and mdcat does not have a fallback currently (see [GH-73]).

## [0.12.1] – 2018-12-24
### Fixed
- Do not add newline after inline text with styles disabled (see [GH-49]).

[GH-49]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/49

## [0.12.0] – 2018-12-20
### Added
- Add `TerminalCapability` struct as replacement for `mdcat::Terminal` trait to
  remove dynamic dispatch and allow for more accurate and less complicated
  conditional compilation of terminal support for different platforms (see
  [GH-45]).
- Move to Rust 2018, and raise minimum supported Rust version to 1.31 (see
  [GH-46]).

### Changed
- Drop support for Rust 1.29 and older.
- Do not test specific Rust on versions on Travis CI any longer; Rust stable
  becomes the lowest supported Rust version.

### Removed
- `mdcat::Terminal` trait and implementations (see [GH-45]).

### Fixed
- Set hostname to local hostname for inline links to `file://` URLs, which
  should properly resolve `file://` URLs over SSH (see [OSC 8 file URLs],
  [GH-42] and [GH-44]).

## [0.11.0] – 2018-10-25
### Changed
- Always print colours regardless of whether stdout if a tty or not.
- Replace `--colour` option with a `--no-colour` flag to turn off styled output.
- `mdcat::push_tty` no longer takes ownership of the `terminal` argument (see
  [GH-41]).
- Travis CI builds Windows binaries now.
- Test formatting output.

[GH-41]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/41

## [0.10.1] – 2018-09-09
### Fixed
- Properly package musl binary on Travis CI; restores Linux binary in releases.

## [0.10.0] – 2018-09-09
### Added
- Support colours on Windows 10 console (see [GH-36]).
- Support musl target on Linux (see [GH-37] and [GH-38]).
- Published Linux binary statically links musl now, and has no runtime
  dependencies (see [GH-29] and [GH-38]).

## [0.9.2] – 2018-08-26
### Fixed
- Do not falsely ignore deployments from Travis CI for Linux and macOS.

## [0.9.1] – 2018-08-26
### Added

### Fixed
- Correctly build macOS and Linux binaries on Travis CI.

[GH-28]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/28

## [0.9.0] – 2018-08-26
### Added
- `mdcat` builds on Windows now (see [GH-33] and [GH-34]).

  new `Terminal` trait and dynamic dispatch (see [GH-35]).
- Allow to disable specific terminal backends (see [GH-35]).

[GH-35]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/35

## [0.8.0] – 2018-02-15
### Added
- Render SVG images in iTerm2 with `rsvg-convert` (requires `librsvg`).
- Expose `TerminalWrite` in `mdcat` crate (see [GH-20]).

[GH-20]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/20

## [0.7.0] – 2018-02-08
### Added
- Show images from HTTP and HTTPS URLs inline in iTerm2.
- Add `--local` flag to render only local images inline; for remote images, eg,
  HTTP URLs, show only the image title and the URL.
- Expose `mdcat` as a library crate (see [GH-18]), but with no guarantees
  about a stable interface, as `mdcat` stays at version 0.x for now.
- Show `--help` with colours.

### Changed
- Adhere to Semantic Versioning, but stay pre-1.0 so anything still goes.

[GH-18]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/18

## [0.6.0] – 2018-02-02
### Added
- Show inline images in [Terminology] (see [GH-16).

[Terminology]: http://terminolo.gy
[GH-16]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/16

### Changed
- Improve `--help` output: Hide some redundant options, add a bug reporting URL
  and explain the purpose of `mdcat`.
- Reduce dependencies and thus build time

## [0.5.0] – 2018-01-27
### Added
- Show links inline in iTerm2 and terminals based on VTE 0.50 or newer (see
  [GH-8], [GH-14] and [GH-15]).

[GH-8]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/8
[GH-14]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/14
[GH-15]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/issues/15

### Changed
- Improve `--help` output.

### Fixed
- Remove redundant default value from `--colour` help text (see [GH-10]).

[GH-10]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/pull/10

## [0.4.0] – 2018-01-21
### Changed
- Use 8-bit ANSI colours for syntax highlighting to fit all kinds of terminal
  colour themes.

### Fixed

  highlighting.

## [0.3.0] – 2018-01-19
### Added
