## Features

`mdcat` works best with [iTerm2] or a compatible terminal emulator, and a good
terminal font with italic characters.  Then it

* nicely renders all basic CommonMark syntax (no [tables][GH-2] or [footnotes][GH-1] though),
* highlights code blocks with [syntect],
* shows [links][osc8] and images inline in supported terminals (see above, where "Pixabay" is a clickable link!),
* adds jump marks for headings in [iTerm2] (jump forwards and backwards with
  <key>⇧⌘↓</key> and <key>⇧⌘↑</key>).

## Installation

### Binaries

The [Releases] page provides pre-build binaries for Linux, macOS and Windows.
Use these binaries to try `mdcat`, particularly on Windows.

[Releases]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat/releases

### 3rd party packages

Some package managers include `mdcat`:

* [Homebrew]: `brew install mdcat`
* Arch Linux: [mdcat in AUR][aur]
* Void Linux: `xbps-install -S mdcat`

While these packages may not always be up to date we generally recommend to use
these to keep `mdcat` updated with the rest of the system.

[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh
[aur]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mdcat/

### Building with rustup

You can also build `mdcat` manually with `cargo`.  Install Rust via [rustup] and
run `cargo install mdcat`.  To keep mdcat up to date install [cargo-update] and
run `cargo install-update mdcat`.

[rustup]: https://www.rustup.rs
[cargo-update]: https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/cargo-update

### SVG support

`mdcat` needs `rsvg-convert` to show SVG images in [iTerm2]; otherwise `mdcat`
only shows the image title and URL for SVG images.  Install with `brew install
librsvg`.

[Terminology] supports SVG out of the box and needs no additional tools.

### Future plans

- [ ] Figure out a better way to show HTML [GH-3].
- [ ] CommonMark extensions: Footnotes [GH-1].
- [ ] CommonMark extensions: Tables [GH-2].
- [ ] Ignore soft wraps and wrap inline text a column limit instead [GH-4].
